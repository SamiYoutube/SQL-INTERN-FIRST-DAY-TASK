Here are the answers for the interview questions mentioned in the task
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What is normalization?
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It divides large tables into smaller related tables and defines relationships between them, usually through different normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.).

2. Explain primary vs foreign key.

Primary Key: A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It cannot contain NULL values and must be unique.

Foreign Key: A column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.

3. What are constraints?
Constraints are rules applied to columns to enforce data integrity in a database. Examples include:

NOT NULL – ensures a column cannot have NULL values.

UNIQUE – ensures all values in a column are different.

PRIMARY KEY – uniquely identifies each row.

FOREIGN KEY – maintains referential integrity.

CHECK – ensures a condition is met.

DEFAULT – assigns a default value if none is provided.

4. What is a surrogate key?
A surrogate key is a system-generated unique identifier (like an auto-increment number or UUID) used as the primary key instead of using natural data (e.g., email, SSN). It has no business meaning and is only used for identification.

5. How do you avoid data redundancy?

Apply normalization techniques.

Use foreign keys to establish relationships instead of duplicating data.

Design tables with minimal data duplication.

Follow best practices in database schema design.

6. What is ER diagram?
An Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram is a visual representation of a database structure. It shows:

Entities (tables)

Attributes (columns)

Relationships (connections between entities)

7. What are the types of relationships in DBMS?

One-to-One (1:1) → One entity relates to only one other entity.

One-to-Many (1:N) → One entity relates to many entities.

Many-to-Many (M:N) → Many entities relate to many others (usually implemented using a junction table).

8. Explain the purpose of AUTO_INCREMENT.
AUTO_INCREMENT in MySQL automatically generates a unique sequential number for a column (usually the primary key) whenever a new row is inserted, avoiding manual assignment.

9. What is the default storage engine in MySQL?
The default storage engine in MySQL is InnoDB (since MySQL 5.5). It supports transactions, row-level locking, and foreign keys.

10. What is a composite key?
A composite key is a primary key that consists of two or more columns combined to uniquely identify a record, especially when a single column alone is not sufficient.
